### ‚ú® Core Features

* **Role-Based Access Control**: Fully distinct views and permissions for four different user roles:
    * **Public (Logged-Out)**: Can browse and search the entire catalogue.
    * **Guest (Logged-In)**: Can log in to a limited member dashboard, but cannot issue items.
    * **Member**: Can issue items up to their limit, view their profile, and see their currently issued CDs.
    * **Librarian**: Can view member and inventory tables and manage library operations.
    * **Management**: Can view high-level statistics and reports, including charts.
* **Dynamic Catalogue**: The video library is dynamically rendered and updated from a JavaScript data source.
* **Search Functionality**: Users can filter the video catalogue by title, director, or genre.
* **Light/Dark Mode**: A fully functional theme toggle that respects user preference by saving it to `localStorage`.
* **Interactive Charts**: The management dashboard features a doughnut chart (via Chart.js) showing the distribution of CDs by genre.

### üé® UI/UX Features

* **Single Page Application (SPA)**: The entire application operates without page reloads for a fast, seamless experience.
* **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive and works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
* **Modern Animations**: Subtle scroll-reveal animations and hover effects create a polished user experience.
* **Custom Modals**: Replaces default browser alerts with custom-styled modals for login and notifications.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **HTML5**: For the core structure and content.
* **CSS3**: Custom CSS variables are used for a robust theming system.
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: Handles all the logic, from DOM manipulation and event handling to state management for the SPA. No frameworks or libraries were used for the core application logic.
* **Tailwind CSS (v3)**: Utilized via a CDN for a modern, utility-first approach to styling.
* **Chart.js**: Included via a CDN for data visualization.

- [ ] Add more detailed pages for individual videos.
- [ ] Implement user registration and password authentication.
